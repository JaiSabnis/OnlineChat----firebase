Online chat for datED

Hosting and authentication not built yet. As of now I am simply gettin the username from a prompt. 

Since hosting isnt done ull have to run on ur lappy.

To run the messaging locally on ur lappy. You'll need to run localhost. im using XAMPP. Start apache on XAMPP and open the explorer. In the explorer find hpdocs. in hpdocs transer the datEd folder. go to chrome and run http://localhost/datED/ make sure folder name is same in hpdocs and in the url.
